            By examining the inscriptions recording miraculous cures by Asclepius from Epidaurus 
            and those created by patients or their family members, we learn about who ill individuals
            sought medical help from in antiquity. These inscriptions show different perspectives on 
            miraculous healing and show the connection between health and belief within the ancient world.
            The inscriptions from Epidaurus provide a direct account of cures attributed to Asclepius, showing 
            the types of cures and remedies given. On the other hand, the patient inscriptions offer a more personal 
            perspective of healing, often from the perspective of individuals or their families. These accounts often 
            include descriptions of illnesses cured and gratitude towards the healing deity. By comparing these inscriptions,
            we can identify similarities in how both show the power of belief and the role that belief played in ancient healing 
            practices.

            Understanding the role of Asclepius temples as centers of healing requires looking into their ritual, practices, 
            and procedures. Patients seeking healing at these temples undertook a series of religious acts. Initially, they 
            presented offerings upon arrival, demonstrating their devotion and seeking favour from the gods (MHH 267). 
            This was followed by offering representations of their afflicted body parts, symbolizing the specific area in
            which they sought attention from the healing deity (MHH 267). Conditional offerings were also made, promising 
            further offerings upon being cured (MHH 267). Patients then would locate a place within the temple to sleep in 
            hopes of having divine communication (MHH 268). The belief was that patients would receive dreams or messages 
            from Asclepius which would result in miraculous recovery from Aslepius or some sort of regimen instructed to 
            them (MHH 268). The priests played a crucial role as intermediaries between the deity and the patient, to interpret 
            the messages received during sleep. Their role wasn&#39;t just spiritual guidance, but they were also proficient in medical
            care, much like the physicians in antiquity (MHH 270). They administered treatments such as wound care, surgeries, 
            bathing, and prescribing remedies or medications (MHH 270). Analyzing inscriptions from Epidaurus these temples showed 
            a pattern where titles precede explanations of the illness circumstances, followed by the outcomes of the incubation 
            process. These inscriptions seemed to be very consistent with one another and gave an informative chronological summary 
            of various cures.

        <p>  
            In ancient times, experiencing pain was a common aspect of life. However, seeking medical treatment often occurred only 
            when illnesses became severe. Many individuals had a deep mistrust of physicians, with some even comparing their treatments 
            to being as harmful as the illnesses themselves (MHH 312). Moreover, patients faced significant uncertainty regarding their 
            chances of recovery, and it did not help that physicians&#39; immunity to prosecution, which in some cases led to neglect or 
            even harmful practices. There are recorded instances where patients were abandoned by physicians who determined their 
            illnesses was untreatable or deadly (MHH 312). Disturbingly, there are reports of physicians deliberately prolonging 
            illnesses to get more money from their patients (MHH 312). Now with some context as to healing in antiquity lets move our 
            focus to the inscriptions left by patients. We can find a recurring theme of gratitude towards the gods for their healing 
            interventions. Expressions such as &quot;As an example of your virtue, Asclepius&quot; or &quot;gives thanks to Asclepius and the nymphs&quot; 
            are common in these inscriptions (MHH 322, 324). Some also recount failed attempts at healing by physicians, which showed 
            the desperation that drove individuals to seek divine intervention after already trying traditional medical approches (MHH 323).

        <p> Looking into the information provided by the inscriptions. The inscriptions from patients express gratitude to 
            the gods and often detail the specific condition that was cured, offering a personalized account of their healing 
            experience (MHH 322). In contrast, the inscriptions from Epidaurus provide a concise overview, focusing on the 
            timeline of treatment received (MHH 272). Furthermore, the patient inscriptions frequently include contextual 
            information about why they sought treatment at the temples. Some individuals mention their reluctance to spend money 
            on physicians, while others had already tried conventional medical treatments without success (MHH 322, 323). For 
            example Felix Asianus’s inscription states that “Abandoned by Physicians” (MHH 323). These details show use what 
            motivated some to seek out other ways of healing.</p>
        
        <p>
            Within the patient inscriptions, there are instances where individuals recount dreams during incubation. For example, 
            one inscription describes a person being inspired to lift a rock, resulting in the miraculous curing of their paralyzed 
            hand (MHH 322). This sort of healing is simillar to remiedies given during incubation in Asclepius temples. Additionally, 
            there are inscriptions that narrate miraculous recoveries, one example being of a temple attendant&#39;s account of asking 
            Asclepius to heal their gout and experiencing a miraculous healing (MHH 323). Comparably inscriptions from Epidaurus have 
            many instances with perceived divine intervention curring them within incubation miracoulouly. This shows a similarity 
            between the two inscription of both direct and indirect divine intervention (MHH 272). Overall, the inscriptions from 
            patients and those from Epidaurus provide complementary perspectives on ancient healing practices, showing two different 
            perspectives to similar treatments one as more of and overview and one from the point of view of the individual.

            In exploring the inscriptions detailing miraculous cures by Asclepius at Epidaurus and those written by patients or their families, we gained new insights into the ancient healing. The Epidaurus inscriptions showed a direct account of divine interventions that was performed, showing the power of belief in ancient healing. The patient inscriptions provided a more personal point of  view in the miraculou healing, emphasizing gratitude towards the healing deity. By comparing these sets of inscriptions, we can find a common theme of the power of belief in ancient healing. The rituals and practices at Asclepius temples, coupled with the dual role of priests as spiritual guides and medical caregivers, showed the blend of religious beliefs and practical medical interventions. In general we were able to find overlap between both inscription that showed that although they were written from different perspectives they recount the same experience in essence.
